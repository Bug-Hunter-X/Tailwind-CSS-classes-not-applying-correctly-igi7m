```javascript
//Check for CSS Specificity Conflicts:
/* Ensure that more specific rules aren't overriding your Tailwind classes. 
   Use browser developer tools to inspect the element and identify conflicting styles.*/

//Correct Tailwind Configuration:
/* Verify that your `tailwind.config.js` (or `tailwind.config.cjs`) file is correctly configured and includes the necessary plugins.
   Ensure that the `content` array includes all relevant HTML files where you are using Tailwind classes.*/

//Verify that no javascript overrides styles:
/* Make sure that your javascript isn't manipulating the element's inline styles (or using methods that override Tailwind's CSS).*/

//Example of potential fix (adjust as needed for your specific conflict):
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700 relative z-10">
  <p>This text should have a red background, and blue on hover.</p>
</div>
